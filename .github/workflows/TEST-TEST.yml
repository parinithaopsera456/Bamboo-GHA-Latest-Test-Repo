# Note: Bamboo-specific features like artifact-subscriptions, triggers, and branch handling do not have direct equivalents in GitHub Actions.
# - GitHub Actions does not natively support artifact subscriptions; manual steps or alternative solutions may be needed.
# - Bamboo's branch handling and integration strategies need manual implementation in GitHub Actions.
